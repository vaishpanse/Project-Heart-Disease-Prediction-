# Heart Disease Prediction

### Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes using linear regression.<br>
This project utilizes a dataset containing information about patients' medical attributes, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, to train a linear regression model. The trained model can then predict the probability of a patient having heart disease based on their medical profile.
